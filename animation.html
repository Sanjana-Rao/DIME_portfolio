                To meet the guideline for incorporating meaningful text and transitions, I created a title card that introduced the topic, “How Do Lungs Work?” The elements of the title card slid in and out of view, creating a dynamic opening transition. Using Adobe Animate, I designed vector illustrations of lungs and animated them to expand and contract using a Breathe effect. This visually represented the inhalation and exhalation process. To depict airflow during breathing, I animated arrows to move in and out of the lungs. These arrows were created as vector shapes and used the Wipe effect and decreased transparency. The colors of the arrows were blue for inhaled oxygen and red for exhaled carbon dioxide to enhance clarity. I used the Pop effect to animate oxygen (O₂) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) molecules. I recorded a voiceover to explain the scientific process in simple terms. Throughout the animation, transitions like Fade and Slide were used to ensure smooth scene changes and topic introduction.
