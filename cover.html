                Part 1: Digital Book Cover (Bitmap Imagery)<br>
                Book Title: All the Light We Cannot See <br>
                Author: Anthony Doerr<br>
            </p><p>
                This is a dual-narrative novel set during World War II, following the lives of two characters—Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind French girl, and Werner Pfennig, a German boy with a talent for radios. Marie-Laure flees with her father from Paris to the coastal town of Saint-Malo after the Nazi occupation. Werner, an orphan with exceptional engineering skills, is recruited into a Nazi academy and later sent on missions to trace resistance radio broadcasts. Their stories intersect when Werner's team tracks Marie-Laure’s radio transmissions from her uncle’s attic, where she reads educational broadcasts to resist the Nazis. As the Allied forces bomb Saint-Malo, Werner finds Marie-Laure and helps save her, redeeming himself before dying in the chaos. 
            </p><p>
                This is one of my favorite novels as it explores themes of hope, resilience, and the unseen connections between people, symbolized by light, radio waves, and the act of resistance. The book cover I designed includes a lighthouse to symbolize Marie-Laure, who becomes a guiding force for Werner, helping him disillusion himself from the Nazi regime through her radio transmissions. The light beam cast by the lighthouse includes faint white radio waves, symbolizing the transformative impact of those transmissions and how they lead Werner to track her location. The ocean waves represent Saint-Malo, the coastal town where Marie’s story culminates. I sourced the images from Pinterest and added Duotone filters and a white border to blend them together seamlessly.
            </p><p>
                The cover has a vintage, cartoony style, reflecting how both the protagonists are children and also the WW2 setting. The colors and elements evoke themes of solitude, strength, and persistence—qualities embodied by both the lighthouse and Marie-Laure. I designed the spine of the book to include the title in braille as a nod to Marie-Laure’s blindness, while also reflecting my personal belief in the importance of accessibility in design (similar to how alt text added to photos enhances web accessibility). Techniques such as overlaying, opacity adjustments, layering, color contrast and negative space were used for this assignment.

                Part 2: Logo (Vector Imagery)<br>
                Fictitious Business Name: Cone Zone<br>
            </p><p>    
                I designed this logo for an ice cream shop called “Cone Zone” and it combines fun, inviting elements with subtle symbolism. The yellow smiley face at the center represents not just the letter ‘O’, but also the happiness and satisfaction experienced by customers when visiting the store. Its melting design reflects the melting nature of ice cream. The “ONE” part is shared by both words in the name, reinforcing the idea that Cone Zone is a “one-stop shop for all your ice cream needs,” which can also serve as the tagline for the store. The rounded, playful brown font reminds the customer of a waffle cone, enhancing the lighthearted and inviting feel of the brand. The style fits well for a family-friendly ice cream business, appealing to both children and adults alike. I used techniques such as typography customization, layering, and composition in designing this logo.
